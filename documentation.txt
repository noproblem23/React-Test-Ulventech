1. index.js:

Imports necessary dependencies like React, Redux, and middleware.
Creates the Redux store using the legacy_createStore function from Redux, along with applying the thunk middleware.
Renders the main application component (App) wrapped in a Redux Provider component, which makes the Redux store available to the entire app.
Also renders a Spinner component, likely used for showing loading states.
Calls reportWebVitals to measure performance.

2. App.js:

Imports various dependencies, including the main app component (UserList), actions, and hooks.
Uses the useEffect hook to fetch users when the component mounts.
Renders a title and either an error message or the list of users based on API errors.
Connects the component to Redux store using connect to map state and dispatch functions.

3. UserList.js:

Renders a list of user cards by mapping through the users prop and passing each user's data to the UserCard component.
Each user card displays user information.

4. UserCard.js:

Renders a card displaying user information, including name, email, and phone.
Provides a "Remove" button to delete the user by dispatching the deleteUser action.

5. actions/index.js:

Defines action types and action creators related to loading, fetching users, API errors, and deleting users.
fetchUsers action creator fetches user data from an API using fetch and Redux-Thunk middleware.
Uses the trackPromise function from react-promise-tracker to track loading state.
getUserResponse action creator formats fetched user data and dispatches it to the reducer.
apiError action creator dispatches an error message to the reducer on API fetch failure.


Additional Explanations:

Redux: Redux is a state management library used to manage the application's state and state changes. Actions and reducers are used to handle state updates in a predictable manner.

Redux Thunk: Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return functions instead of plain actions. This is particularly useful for handling asynchronous actions like API requests.

Provider: The Provider component from the react-redux library wraps your application and provides access to the Redux store for all connected components.

connect: The connect function from react-redux connects your React components to the Redux store, allowing them to access state and dispatch actions.

useEffect: The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It's often used for actions like fetching data when a component mounts.

Error Handling: The code includes error handling for API fetch failures, displaying error messages when the API call encounters an error.

UI Components: The application is divided into modular UI components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Styling: Styling is managed through CSS files imported into each component.

This application fetches user data from an API, displays it in a user-friendly manner, allows users to be deleted, and handles loading and errors gracefully. It uses Redux for state management and Redux Thunk for asynchronous actions.
